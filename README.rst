``block_diag_ilu`` is an open source `C++ single header-file implementation
<https://github.com/chemreac/block_diag_ilu/tree/master/block_diag_ilu/include>`_ of an
incomplete LU decomposition routine suitable for diagonally dominant (square) block diagonal
matrices with sub- and super diagonals of small magnitude. It is useful for
preconditioning linear systems. The use-case in mind is for integrating discretized PDEs of mixed
chemical kinetics / diffusion problems where the diffusion process may be accurately
considered a mild perturbation.

A picture is worth a thousand words, so if your matrix looks anything like this:

   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Diagonally dominant block diagonal matrix with sub- and super-diagonals
   
then its LU decomposition then looks like this:

   :scale: 50%
   :alt: LU decomposition of same matrix

then ``block_diag_ilu`` should be able to save quite a bit of time when
solving linear systems approximately, *e.g.* for preconditioning.

Conditional compilation
-----------------------
The following macros affect the compilation:

``setup.py`` will set these when envinronment variables with those are set to "1".
